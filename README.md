The project can be compiled with Kotlin `1.9.24`
```
./gradlew -PkotlinVersion=1.9.24 compileTestKotlin
```
But compilation fails with Kotlin `2.1.21`
```
./gradlew -PkotlinVersion=2.1.21 compileTestKotlin
```
How to compile project with Kotlin `2.1.21`?
What is the right way to get out of the type mismatch trap?
